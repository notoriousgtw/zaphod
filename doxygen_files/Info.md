## What is Zaphod Engine?
Zaphod Engine is a game/application engine built from the ground up using as few external libraries as possible.
It's mainly a learning exercise for myself,and the intention is for it to balance functionality, ease of use, and performannce.

## How to build
```
cmake --preset release && cmake --build --preset release-build
```
or (for debug)
```
cmake --preset debug && cmake --build --preset debug-build
```
